Loki CYD is a Tamagotchi-style pentesting companion that autonomously scans networks, discovers hosts, identifies services, brute forces credentials, and displays everything through an animated virtual pet interface on the ESP32 CYD touchscreen.

## Inspiration & Credits

This project is a port of [Loki](https://github.com/pineapple-pager-projects/pineapple_pager_loki) (originally built for the WiFi Pineapple Pager) to the ESP32 Cheap Yellow Display platform.

The original Loki was itself inspired by [Bjorn](https://github.com/infinition/Bjorn) — the autonomous network reconnaissance Tamagotchi.

Special thanks to [HaleHound-CYD](https://github.com/JesseCHale/HaleHound-CYD) by JesseCHale — an excellent offensive security toolkit for the CYD that demonstrated what's possible on this hardware. HaleHound's IoT Recon module, touch handling, display architecture, and SPI bus management provided invaluable reference for understanding the CYD platform. Some early development was done as a fork of HaleHound before Loki CYD became its own project.

## Features

### Virtual Pet UI
- Animated character with per-state sprite animations (idle, scanning, attacking, stealing, etc.)
- 3x3 stat grid with themed icons (Hosts, Ports, Vulns, Creds, Zombies, Data, NetworkKB, Level, Attacks)
- XP counter with gold rune icon
- Status bar with 42x42 animated status icon + two-line status text
- Speech bubble with randomized Loki-themed commentary
- 6-line color-coded attack log (kill feed)
- WiFi connection status indicator

### Network Reconnaissance
- **ARP Host Discovery** — same method as `nmap -sn` on local networks. Batched ARP scanning finds all alive hosts on the subnet.
- **Port Scanning** — TCP connect scan on 9 target ports per discovered host
- **Service Identification** — Banner grabbing for HTTP, FTP, SSH, Telnet, MySQL with device fingerprinting
- **MAC OUI Vendor Lookup** — 9,673 vendor entries with binary search identify device manufacturers (Apple, Samsung, Cisco, etc.)
- **Device Classification** — Vendor + port analysis classifies devices as Phone, Laptop, Router, Camera, NAS, Printer, IoT, Server, etc.

### Brute Force Attacks
- **SSH** — Real SSH password authentication via LibSSH-ESP32
- **FTP** — USER/PASS protocol with anonymous login detection
- **Telnet** — Login/password prompt detection with shell verification
- **HTTP/HTTPS** — Basic auth brute force (ports 80, 443, 8080)
- **MySQL** — Empty password / no-auth detection
- **SMB** — Service detection and negotiate probe (full NTLM in development)
- **RDP** — Service detection (full CredSSP/NLA in development)

### Credential Management
- Loki's original dictionary: 11 usernames × 20 passwords = 242 credential combinations
- Custom wordlist support via SD card (`/loki/creds.txt`)
- All cracked credentials stored with IP, port, username, password
- Credentials persist to SPIFFS flash (survives reboots)
- Downloadable via web UI

### Theme System
- **Built-in fallback theme** — 7 still sprites + background in PROGMEM, works without SD card
- **SD card animated themes** — Full animation with 50-300 frames per theme
- **6 themes included** — Loki, Loki Dark, Bjorn, Clown, Knight, Pirate
- **Fully customizable** — Colors, layout coordinates, animation timing all configurable via `theme.cfg`
- **Theme picker** — Switch themes from the touchscreen menu
- See [THEME_DEVELOPMENT.md](THEME_DEVELOPMENT.md) for creating custom themes

### Touch Interface
- 11-item main menu (WiFi, Auto, Web UI, Manual, Hosts, Credentials, Attack Log, Stats, Theme, Brightness, Back)
- WiFi network picker with signal strength bars
- On-screen QWERTY keyboard (lower/upper/symbols) with show/hide password toggle
- Scrollable host list with device details
- Manual attack selection per host
- Touch calibration on first boot (3.5" displays)
- Brightness control (25/50/75/100%)

### Web UI
- Dashboard with live stats at `http://<cyd-ip>/`
- `/creds` — JSON credentials download
- `/log` — Plain text attack log
- `/screenshot` — Live BMP screenshot of the display
- `/files` — SPIFFS file listing
- `/download?file=<path>` — Download any stored file
- `/stats` — JSON stats API
- `/start` and `/stop` — Scan control

### Persistence
- **WiFi credentials** — saved to NVS, auto-reconnects on boot
- **Scan results** — credentials, devices, attack log saved to SPIFFS
- **Scores** — XP and all stats persist across reboots
- **Web UI setting** — on/off state persists
- **SD card** — optional, used for themes, loot storage, custom wordlists, scan reports
